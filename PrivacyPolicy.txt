If you complete an achievement, that information is sent out so that you can get the achievement for 
Google Play Games. 
If I add a leaderboard for the stonk simulator game your score will also be collected if you chose
to sign into Google Play. 
This app will access your phone's accelerometer, but won't store that information.
All settings information for this app is stored locally. If you delete the app, the information is gone.
There is a nigh impossible challenge that once completed, I request you email me that you managed to do it.
This is not done automatically.
If you somehow manage to crash my app, which I have tried to make foolproof, Google will collect crash information,
such as what kind of device it occured on, and your operating system, and give me the stack trace as well.
I will likely ignore this information because whatever you did was probably an edge case.
